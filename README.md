# React Native useEffect Hook: Asynchronous Operation Error Handling and Cleanup

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving the `useEffect` hook, specifically concerning asynchronous operations and the lack of proper error handling in both the main effect and its cleanup function.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved error handling and resource management.

The issue arises when asynchronous tasks (e.g., network requests) are performed within `useEffect` without adequate error handling. Additionally, neglecting to manage potential cleanup tasks appropriately within the returned function from `useEffect` can lead to memory leaks or unexpected side effects when the component unmounts.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error management and careful cleanup to build robust and reliable React Native applications.
