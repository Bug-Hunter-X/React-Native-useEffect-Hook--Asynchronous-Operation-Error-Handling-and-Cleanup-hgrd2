In React Native, a seemingly innocuous error can stem from incorrect usage of the `useEffect` hook, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations and cleanup functions.  For instance, returning a cleanup function within `useEffect` that doesn't properly handle potential errors or race conditions can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. Consider this scenario: 
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('some_url');
      const data = await response.json();
      setData(data);
    } catch (error) {
      // Error handling missing here! 
    }
  };
  fetchData();
  return () => {
    // No cleanup needed, but missing error handling
  };
}, []);
```
This code lacks proper error handling within the `fetchData` function and the cleanup function.  If the fetch fails or the component unmounts before the fetch completes, this could result in silent failures or crashes.
